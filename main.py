# Python Tutorial

"""
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code
readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim
to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects. Python is dynamically typed and
garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (especially, procedural
programming), object-oriented, and functional programming. It is also extended with libraries for string processing,
web development, and more.
