# Python Variables
"""
Variables are containers for storing data values.

# Creating Variables
"""
Python has no command for declaring a variable.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

# Example
x = 5
y = "Vidyesh"
print(x)
print(y)

# Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.
# Example
x = 4  # x is of type int
x = "Sally"  # x is now of type str
print(x+" is 4 years old")
