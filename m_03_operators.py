# Operators
"""
Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:
+   Addition
-   Subtraction
*   Multiplication
/   Division
%   Modulus
**  Exponentiation
//  Floor division

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:
=   x = 5   x = 5
+=  x += 3  x = x + 3
-=  x -= 3  x = x - 3
*=  x *= 3  x = x * 3
/=  x /= 3  x = x / 3
%=  x %= 3  x = x % 3
//= x //= 3 x = x // 3
**= x **= 3 x = x ** 3
&=  x &= 3  x = x & 3
|=  x |= 3  x = x | 3
^=  x ^= 3  x = x ^ 3
>>= x >>= 3 x = x >> 3
<<= x <<= 3 x = x << 3

Comparison operators are used to compare two values:
==  Equal
!=  Not equal
>   Greater than
<   Less than
>=  Greater than or equal to
<=  Less than or equal to

Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:
and Returns True if both statements are true
or  Returns True if one of the statements is true
not Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true

Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object,
with the same memory location:
is  Returns True if both variables are the same object
is not  Returns True if both variables are not the same object

Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:
in  Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object
not in  Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object

Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers:
&   AND Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
|   OR  Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
^   XOR Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
~   NOT Inverts all the bits
<<  Zero fill left shift Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
>>  Signed right shift Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off

Operator Precedence
Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic expression.
